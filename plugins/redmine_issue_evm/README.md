# Earned Value Management (EVM) Calculation Plugin

[![Rate at redmine.org](http://img.shields.io/badge/rate%20at-redmine.org-blue.svg?style=flat)](http://www.redmine.org/plugins/redmine_issue_evm)

This plugin provides the function of calculating evm of projects . EVM can help you to track your project progress and its status and to forecast the future performance of the project.

## Current Version
4.5.3

## Compatibility
Redmine 4.0.0 and above

> *Notification*
>
> The redmine3.4.x compatible version in branch "redmine3-4-3".
> https://github.com/momibun926/redmine_issue_evm/tree/redmine3-4-3

## Main features
* Calculate EVM
* Show project metrics (Duration, Amount of target issues, Show amount of issues by version, asignee, and tracker)
* Chart with EVM (PV,EV,AC)
* Set the baseline　and show history

## Baseline
If you set baseline, you can know easily how project divergence is and whether new task (issues) can be added by chart. In other words, you can see whether your estimated daily workload is over or not by chart.
PV is based on your baseline. In addition, you can set calculation without baseline by options.

## Additional options
* Explanation of EVM
* Chart with Project Performance (SPI,CPI,CR)
* Select past baseline
* Change the calculating basic date
* Change the level of the forecast
* Calculate EVM of assignees, parent issues, trackers, and versions (see Screenshots)
* Show issues of exclude EVM calculation
* Show unfinished issues

## workig days
1. Excluding weekends and holidays
2. If it is only weekends or holidays, make it a working day
3. Use holidays gem -> Regional settings are set in the common setting page(common setting link in contextial)

Example)

In Japan, May 3, May 4, May 5 are holidays

* Including weekends and holidays

|Start date          |Due date            |Estimated time |Working day|PV per day|
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
|May 1, 2017 (Monday)|May 8, 2017 (Monday)|12 hours       |3 days     |4 hours   |

* Including only a few weekends and holidays

|Start date          |Due date            |Estimated time |Working day|PV per day|
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
|May 1, 2017 (Monday)|May 7, 2017 (Sunday)|10 hours       |2 days     |5 hours   |

* Only weekends and holidays

|Start date          |Due date            |Estimated time |Working day|PV per day|
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------|----------|
|May 3, 2017 (Wed)   |May 7, 2017 (Sunday)|20 hours       |5 days     |4 hours   |

# How to calculate EVM
The below are used for EVM.

* start date
* due date　(If empty, effective of version)
* estimated time (If you set it as 0, you will not get PV, CV)
* spent time

If you input these into your project, it can help you to calculate both a single issue’s EVM and whole project’s one.

* PV: Dividing estimated time by the days (from start date to due date(or effective date of version )) to get daily workload
* EV: After issues are closed, you can get EV.　When the progress rate is set, it is calculated by estimated time. (progress rate on the day when the progress is set.)
* AC: Total work hours of PV issues.

**Example**

(1) Create an issue with:

* start date:  2015/08/01
* due date:  2015/08/03
* estimated time: 24 hours

At that time, only PV is calculated. As you have not closed the issue yet, EV equals 0.
PV: Dividing estimated time: 24hours by 3 days (from start date to due date)

| EVM | 8/1 | 8/2 | 8/3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PV  | 8   | 16  | 24  |
| EV  | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| AC  | 0   | 0   | 0   |

(2) Input your spent time.

8/1: 10.0hours  8/2: 6.0hours 8/3: 8.0hours

| EVM | 8/1 | 8/2 | 8/3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PV  | 8   | 16  | 24  |
| EV  | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| AC  | 10  | 16  | 24  |

(3) After finishing the issue, close it on 8/3. EV will be calculated on 8/3.

| EVM | 8/1 | 8/2 | 8/3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PV  | 8   | 16  | 24  |
| EV  | 0   | 0   | 24  |
| AC  | 10  | 16  | 24  |

Based on these data, EVM and chart are created.

# Chart
2 types of charts can be displayed.

**Main chart**

Show PV,EV,AC with baseline.Display unclosed issues according to the baseline.

**Performance chart**

Show SPI,CPI,CR of the days involved with PV,EV,AC
